# Spotify ETL Project ðŸŽµ

This project extracts, transforms, and loads data from a Spotify playlist using the Spotify Web API.

## Features
- Fetch playlist details (name, description, owner, total tracks).
- Extract song details (name, artist, album, release date, etc.).
- Save the data to a local CSV or an S3 bucket.

## Files

- `credentials.txt`: Stores Spotify client ID and secret (excluded from GitHub for security).
- `playlist_tracks.csv`: Sample output of the ETL process.

2. Add your credentials to `credentials.txt`:
3. Install dependencies:

Alternatively,

4. Run the script:
python spotify_main.py
